This is a text-based dungeon-crawling game created with C++.

WARNING: This is a demo of a program still undergoing active development. Not all features may work properly. Combat is not fully implemented.

FEATURES:
- Dungeon map layouts are randomly generated with every new game.
- Items may be dropped in any room, and will persist until you end the game (in case you'd like to grab them later).

GUIDE:
- Follow the on-screen prompts in order to navigate the dungeon. 
- Keys may need to be located in order to enter certain areas.
- The demo is "won" by entering the room containing the exit door!

Have fun!
